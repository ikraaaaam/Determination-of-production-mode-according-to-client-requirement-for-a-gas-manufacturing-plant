	Description of dataset: 

This is a partial part of a project I did under AILABS. The project was all about determination of production mode according to client requirement for a gas manufacturing plant. There were two datasets given for this problem. The first dataset was about production of three different gases according to dates. At the very beginning there was 384 different days and their production values.  The second dataset was about process variables according to 15 minutes time interval. There was in total 50 values and 35040 datapoints out there.
